This super small project started just as an excuse to practice more CSSGrid. But eventually I found myself trying to add some functional details, until I realized I didn't know how to make an element affect others with css only. 
It was a fun challenge and I learned a lot while searching documentation, so I figured why not include this here.

Basically this a navigation page for a text-roleplay journal (it's a weird hobby, I know), made for personal use.

<b>Please keep in mind that</b>:
- It's HTML/CSS only, because the journal platform doesn't support JS. 
- The navigation page is a journal entry, which explains the lack of HTML. Some tags were added for preview purposes.
- External CSS doesn't get applied when viewing the entry in the platform's style. Which is why there's some inline CSS in the HTML file.
- The above is also why only the functionality is kept in the CSS file.

ps:
... it probably could be a lot prettier but it was meant to have this simple, old JRPG's menu window feel.
And please don't mind the cat-themed image and icon, they're just placeholders I chose on a whim.
